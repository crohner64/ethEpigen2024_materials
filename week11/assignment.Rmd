## Plot a heatmap of the methylation levels of the genes in top 5 DMR regions.


The heatmap displays methylation levels of specific genes across cancer (C1, C2, C3) and normal (N1, N2, N3) samples, grouped by pairs (pair1, pair2, pair3). Key observations include distinct clustering of cancer and normal samples, indicating significant differences in methylation patterns. Genes such as TRMU, CELSR1 show higher methylation in normal samples compared to normal ones. This suggests these genes might play a role in the methylation changes associated with cancer. The clustering and methylation patterns imply that methylation profiling can differentiate between cancerous and normal tissues effectively.

```{r}
# Get methylation levels
metPr <- bsseq::getMeth(bs, regions=dmrRanges, what="perRegion")
colnames(metPr) <- colnames(bs)
rownames(metPr) <- dmrRanges$overlapping.genes

# Filter out rows with NA values
metPr <- metPr[!is.na(rowSums(metPr)),]

# Plot heatmap
annotationCol <- as.data.frame(pData(bs))
rownames(annotationCol) <- colnames(metPr)
pheatmap::pheatmap(metPr, 
                   cluster_rows=TRUE, 
                   cluster_cols=FALSE,

## Run an enrichment analysis (rGREAT) of the genes within DMRs vs all genes of chromosome 22.


```{r}
# Prepare data for GREAT
# Load all genes of chromosome 22
allGenes <- genesChr22

# Get the gene names within the top 5 DMRs
dmrGenes <- unlist(tstrsplit(dmrRanges$overlapping.genes, split=", "))
dmrGenes <- dmrGenes[!is.na(dmrGenes)]
dmrGeneRanges <- genesChr22[genesChr22$gene_name %in% dmrGenes]

# Create GREAT job
job <- submitGreatJob(dmrGeneRanges, bg=allGenes, species="hg38")

# Get enrichment table
enrichmentTable <- getEnrichmentTables(job)
head(enrichmentTable[[1]])
```

## What is the enrichment analysis testing?

The enrichment analysis using rGREAT tests whether the genes within the top 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are significantly associated with specific biological functions, pathways, or genomic features compared to all genes on chromosome 22. This analysis aims to identify whether certain gene ontology (GO) terms, pathways, or genomic annotations are overrepresented among the genes associated with the DMRs, suggesting that these biological processes or functions may be impacted by the observed methylation changes.

## Description of the Results

The enrichment analysis reveals significant associations between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and specific biological functions. Notably, the term "tRNA binding" (GO:0000049) exhibits a very high fold enrichment of 185.25, indicating that genes related to tRNA binding are vastly overrepresented in the DMRs. This finding is statistically significant with a raw p-value of \(3.27 \times 10^{-5}\), though the adjusted p-value is 0.138, suggesting a need for cautious interpretation.

Similarly, "calcium ion binding" (GO:0005509) shows a fold enrichment of 26.46 and a raw p-value of \(8.31 \times 10^{-5}\), pointing to an overrepresentation of genes involved in calcium ion binding within the DMRs. The adjusted p-value here is 0.176.

Other terms such as "sulfurtransferase activity" (GO:0016783) and "transferase activity, transferring sulfur-containing groups" (GO:0016782) also display significant fold enrichments of 61.75 and 35.29, respectively, with raw p-values indicating notable enrichment, though their adjusted p-values suggest these findings should be interpreted with caution.

The term "3'-5' DNA helicase activity" (GO:0043138) also shows a notable fold enrichment of 123.50 with a raw p-value of \(8.08 \times 10^{-3}\). This indicates that genes involved in 3'-5' DNA helicase activity are significantly overrepresented in the DMRs, which could suggest a potential impact of differential methylation on DNA repair and replication processes. However, the adjusted p-value is 1.0, indicating that this result might not be significant after adjusting for multiple testing.

Overall, the analysis indicates that differential methylation is likely influencing key biological processes such as tRNA binding and calcium ion binding, which could have important implications for gene regulation and cellular function.
